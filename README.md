# Wine Classifier App
## *Wine Spectator*'s Top 100 Wines, 1988-2020

This repository contains the code to serve a scikit-learn SVM text classification model using Python and Flask. The model takes in a wine review and returns the style of the wine based on the text.

You can read more about the classifier model in its [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ewotawa/top_100_wines_2020_ML). This repository contains the files for a text classification machine learning model based on the English-language wine reviews from 1988 to 2020 included in the *Wine Spectator* Top 100 wine lists. Below are resources referenced for the project.
